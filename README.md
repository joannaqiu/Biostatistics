# This project tries to address the following questions:
# 1. Are migraines truly related to type II diabetes or is it a result of the medicine an individual having migraines takes that can contribute to a negative relationship with type II diabetes? 

# 2. Is there any interaction effect between types of drugs people are taking and having a migraine on getting type II diabetes?

# 3. Does headache have a different effect on type II diabetes compared to migraine?
